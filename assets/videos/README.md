Video assets
============

Put interior 360° videos here using these names so the site picks them up:

- assets/videos/interior/kitchen-360.mp4
- assets/videos/interior/kitchen-360.webm
- assets/videos/interior/sunroom-360.mp4
- assets/videos/interior/sunroom-360.webm
  (temporary fallback also supported):
 - assets/videos/interior/kitchen-360.mov
 - assets/videos/interior/sunroom-360.mov

Posters (thumbnails) are optional; defaults fall back to still photos:

- assets/images/interior/kitchen-360-poster.jpg (optional)
- assets/images/interior/sunroom-360-poster.jpg (optional)

Tips
- Export from Insta360 Studio as equirectangular (360) H.264/H.265 MP4.
- For widest browser support, also transcode to WebM/VP9.
- Keep resolution to 3840×1920 (4K 2:1) if file size is a concern.
 - MOV exports can work in Safari and some Chromium builds; MP4/WebM are preferred for consistent MIME types and playback.
